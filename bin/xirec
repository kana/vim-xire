;;; Environment
;;; ============

;; Represent an environment for xire compilation.
(define-class <xire-environment> ()
  ([macros  ; contain xire macro bindings.
     :init-keyword :macros
     :init-form (make-hash-table 'eq?)]))

;; Represent the current environment for xire compilation.
(define xire-environment
  (make-parameter (make <xire-environment>)))

;; Copy the current xire environment.
(define (xire-environment-copy :optional (environment (xire-environment)))
  (make <xire-environment>
        :macros (hash-table-copy (ref environment 'macros))))




;;; Context
;;; =======

;; Represent the context to compile a xire script.  The difference between
;; <xire-context> and <xire-environment> is that:
;;
;; - <xire-environment> holds global information such as xire macro bindings.
;; - While <xire-context> holds local information, for example, whether a xire
;;   script being compiled is a top-level statement or not.
(define-class <xire-context> ()
  (; Currently, no slot is defined.
   ))




;;; Xire macros
;;; ===========
;;;
;;; Conventions
;;; -----------
;;;
;;; For procedures in this section,
;;;
;;; - Argument called NAME is a symbol.
;;; - Argument called EXPANDER is a procedure which takes one argument, the
;;;   form to expand.

;; Define new xire macro in the current environment.
;; This is just a syntax sugar for xire-register-macro!.
(define-syntax define-xire-macro
  (syntax-rules ()
    [(_ (name form) . body)
     (xire-register-macro! 'name (lambda (form) . body))]))

;; Look up a xire macro with the NAME.
(define (xire-lookup-macro name :optional (environment (xire-environment)))
  (hash-table-get (ref environment 'macros) name #f))

;; Register a xire macro EXPANDER with the NAME into the current CONTEXT.
(define (xire-register-macro! name expander
                              :optional (environment (xire-environment)))
  (hash-table-put! (ref environment 'macros) name expander))




;;; Compiler
;;; ========

;; Translate xire script into Vim script.
;; Xire script is read from INP and resulting Vim script is written into OUTP.
(define (xire-translate inp outp
                        :key (environment (xire-environment-copy))
                             (scheme-environment (make-module #f)))
  (define compiled-vim-script-tree (list))
  (define (finish)
    (write-tree (reverse compiled-vim-script-tree) outp))

  (eval '(extend user) scheme-environment)
  (parameterize ([xire-environment environment])
    (let loop ()
      (match (read inp)
        [(? eof-object?)
         (finish)]
        [(and ((or 'define-xire-macro)
               . _)
              form)
         (eval form scheme-environment)
         (loop)]
        [(and (name . _) form)
         (if (xire-lookup-macro name)
           (push! compiled-vim-script-tree (xire-compile form))
           (eval form scheme-environment))
         (loop)]))))

;; Compile a xire script STATEMENT, then return a resulting Vim script.
;; Resulting Vim script is expressed as a list of strings which can be passed
;; to write-tree provided by text.tree.
(define (xire-compile statement)
  (match-let1 (name . args) statement
    (cond
      [(xire-lookup-macro name)
       => (lambda (expander)
            (expander statement))]
      [else
        (errorf "Invalid xire statement: ~s" statement)])))
